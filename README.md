# GPFM
The official implementation of [GPFM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18449). This project is based on the [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM)

# How to use GPFM as feature extractor
Take the UBC_OCEAN dataset as an example  
Step 1: segment the tissue of the WSI  
```bash
cd Patching
bash get_coor_scripts/UBC_OCEAN.sh
```
Step 2: extract the features using foundation model. Currently, we support ResNet, Ctranspath, PLIP, Phikon, CONCH, UNI, and GPFM.
```bash
# download the weights of released GPFM and put it at `models/ckpts/`.  
cd root_dir_of_project
bash extract_scripts/UBC_OCEAN.sh
```
If you want to use other foundation models, please download the weights and put them at `models/ckpts/`. You can see the `models/__init__.py` for the supported model. You can also simply define your own model (see `models/phikon.py`).
