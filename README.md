# GPFM

The official implementation of [GPFM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18449). 
This project is based on the following great projects:
* [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM)  
* [Dinov2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2)  
see others works of HKUST [SmartLab](https://hkustsmartlab.github.io/)

## TODO List
- [ ] Huggingface lib is under preparing  
- [ ] Downstream tasks are under preparing  

# How to use GPFM as feature extractor
## Using this project
Take the UBC_OCEAN dataset as an example  
Step 1: segment the tissue of the WSI  
```bash
cd Patching
bash get_coor_scripts/UBC_OCEAN.sh
```
Step 2: extract the features using foundation model. Currently, we support ResNet, Ctranspath, PLIP, Phikon, CONCH, UNI, and GPFM.
```bash
# download the weights of released GPFM and put it at `models/ckpts/`.  
cd root_dir_of_project
bash extract_scripts/UBC_OCEAN.sh
```
If you want to use other foundation models, please download the weights and put them at `models/ckpts/`. You can see the `models/__init__.py` for the supported model. You can also simply define your own model (see `models/phikon.py`).  

## Using Huggingface
see https://huggingface.co/majiabo/GPFM for details. (Note: under preparing)  

# How to use unified knowledge distillation to pretrain your model
If you use Slurm system, you could use `pretrain/train_script.sh` to pretrain your model. Note that the default Experts used in this project is `UNI`, `CONCH`, and `Phikon`. Please remeber to download the weights of these models and put them at `pretrain/dinov2/weights/`.  
If you want to change the expert, you could modify the code at `pretrain/dinov2/train/ssl_meta_arch.py` (see line 57).
